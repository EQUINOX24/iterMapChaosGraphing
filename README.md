# iterMapChaosGraphing
Python script for visualizing bifurcation diagrams of 1D and 2D maps similar to Logistic Map.
For 2D maps animation is used to visualize dependence on the control parameter. `generate_gif.py` script needs to be run to compile outputed images into a `.gif` animation.

Checked to run with: python (3.7.4), imageio (2.6.0), numpy (1.16.5), matplotlib (3.1.1)
